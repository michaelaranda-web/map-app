  * Figure out deployment process
    - Had to manually migrate database after deploying app to Heroku:
    
        heroku run --app map-app-proto-two rake db:migrate
  
  * Figure out why Poltergeist keeps breaking
    - Maybe broken, maybe not...possible that MapBox.js is actually broken itself and Poltergeist is just catching it
    - Always getting Javascript errors from external JS libraries...
    - It seemed like maybe recompiling assets worked once, but not anymore?
    
  * Debug why contextmenu event was not working
    - Worked on Ubuntu, but not on Windows?
    - Modify/style(?) map marker so that a right click corresponds to the bottom of the marker, rather than then top-left corner
